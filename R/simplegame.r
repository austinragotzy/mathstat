#' @title Simple Game for Estimation of Expected Gain
#' @description Computes the estimation of expected gain for a game wherein the following rules apply:
#' A player pays p_0 to play. The player then rolls a 6-sided die. If the roll is a 1 or a 2 then the game is over.
#' Otherwise, the player flips a fair coin. If the coin toss results in a tail, they receive $1 and the game is over.
#' Otherwise they draw 2 cards without replacement from the standard deck of 52 cards. If none of the cards is an ace
#' they receive $2, while they receive $10 or $50 is they get 1 or 2 aces respectively. In both cases, the game is over.
#' Let G denote the player's gain. To determine the expected gain, we need the distribution of G. The support of G is
#' the set {-p_0, 1-p_0, 2-p_0, 10-p_0, 50-p_0}. For the associated probabilities we need the distribution of X where
#' X is the number of aces in a draw of 2 cards. The distribution is
#' \eqn{P(X=x) = ( (4 choose x) * (48 choose (2-x)) ) / (52 choose 2) for x=0,1,2}
#'
#' See example 1.8.9 on page 65 of the book.
#'
#' @param amtpaid Initial amount that a player pays (p_0 in description).
#'
#' @return Estimation of expected gain for player.
