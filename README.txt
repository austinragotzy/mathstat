Purpose: Provide overview of mathstat package
Last Updated: 12/12/2018

Package Overview: 
This package illustrates the applicability of the concepts and alogrithms covered in 8th edition of the text 
*Introduction to Mathematical Statics* by Hogg, McKean, and Craig (2018). The topics in which these functions 
apply to includes but are not limited to the following:

1. Probability and Distributions
2. Multivariate Distributions
3. Some Special Distributions 
4. Some Elementary Statistical Inferences 
5. Consistency and Limiting Distributions
6. Maximum Likelihood Methods
7. Sufficiency 
8. Optimal Test of Hypothesis 
9. Inference About Normal Linear Models
10. Nonparametric and Robust Statistics
11. Bayesian Statistics
