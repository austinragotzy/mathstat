<h2>Coin Flip versus Die Roll Game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function simulates a game involving two players. Person A
flips a fair coin initially, with the objective of getting a head. Person B
rolls a fair six-sided die after Person A's move with the obejective of getting
a 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game is repeated until one person is able to complete his
or her objective first thereby winning the game. The winner of the game
receives a 1 while the loser receives a 0.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
abgame()
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function plays one round of the game referenced in
Example 1.4.8 (8th Edition). There is no input required to run this simulation.
The function defines all possible outcomes of a coin toss or the rolling of a
die, as well as calculates the probability of both the coin landing on heads,
and the die landing on one through four.
</p>
